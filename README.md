# AutomationExampleArchitecture

This repository contains the source code and documentation for an automation architecture project. The project is focused on designing and implementing an automation framework that can be used for testing and deploying software applications.

The main objectives of the project are:

To develop a robust and scalable automation framework that can handle a wide range of software applications and testing scenarios.
To provide a set of tools and libraries that can be used to build automated test cases and perform various types of testing, including functional, performance, and security testing.
To integrate the automation framework with other software development and deployment tools, such as version control systems, continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipelines, and monitoring and logging systems.

Thank you for your interest in our automation architecture project!
